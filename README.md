# React Starter _Playground_

> If you're reading thisâ€¦ Welcome. If you'd like to use thisâ€¦ Good luck! ðŸ¤£

This is a playground containing a super-opinionated 'alternative' to the 
ubiquitous `create-react-app`. with a lot more _stuff_ included - examples 
and tidbits and whatnot. There's also a tiny Express server that can be used 
to test the build. There's no 'magic' here - no hidden wizardry. All nails, 
screws, nuts, and bolts are clearly exposed. There may be a little duct tape 
stuck to some parts as well. Take a peek at the `webpack.config.js` file - 
it's not pretty, but it works.

This code isn't here to impress anybody - more likely the opposite. This is a
personal 'playground' where experiments and seemingly pointless code may come to
settle. Please excuse the mess.
